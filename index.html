                <p>Hello and welcome to my website and blog.</p>
                <p>My name is Kerry Lee (my friends call me Kel) and I have been a Stampin Up! Demonstrator since November 2021. I live in central London and am a busy mum of 3 children who keep me on my toes. I love to be creative and share my love of creativity and papercrafting via all of my social media and in person classes and workshops. I have a team called The Crafty Crew which is made up of likeminded, friendly people and I love to support and help them whether that means as a business or a hobby demonstrator.</p>
                <p>I am often asked why I joined Stampin' Up! and I always say the same - the colour co-ordination of cardstocks, designer papers, Inks and embellishments, the quality of the product and ease of use but what I didn't expect or know is that I would join the most amazing community of crafters that I know am lucky enough to call friends.</p>
                <p>Since joining I have attended local, national and international events and still get just as excited for a delivery or looking at a catalogue as the very first time.</p>
                <p>My Crafty Crew team are a mixture of those who want to run their own business and those who want to be part of a crafting team and want to purchase their Stampin' Up! products at a discount. If this sounds like something you would like to be a part of, I would love to welcome you to the team.</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy having a look around and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</p>
                <p>Kerry</p>
