# Creative Crafts with Kel is envisioned as a community hub, where like-minded crafters and hobbyists can come for inspiration, information and to see the important announcements coming from Stampin' Up!

The site homepage contains links to internal pages and sections, external sources for the Stampin' Up! shop and catalogues and a newsletter sign-up form.

Other pages include a 'join the team' page, 'gallery' of pictures and a page to request a physical copy of the catalogues.

In the 'monthly card workshop' section there is information regarding community crafting sessions.  
A place for people to come together in person and craft together.
